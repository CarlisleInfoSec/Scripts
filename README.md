# Monitor_d3d11.sh: Simple script to check for new arcdps from source website, hash it, compare that hash to included hash, and download new arcdps if the hashes don't match, and if they do, create a folder named by the hash and date/time and download the files into there, while retaining a copy elsewhere for future version comparisons. Just for fun.
# semi_automated_hashcat.sh: Very simple password hash cracker used for a password cracking challenge from TryHackMe. Uses rockyou.txt and asks you questions about the password in order to limit processing time.
